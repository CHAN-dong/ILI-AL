# AILI-AL: An Inverted Learned Index with Auxiliary Location for Reliable Keyword Queries in Hybrid-Storage Blockchain

AILI-AL is a novel index structure designed for efficient keyword queries and verification in hybrid-storage blockchain environments. This Java implementation provides a reliable and cost-effective solution for keyword queries based on learned index structures.

## Features

- Supports efficient keyword queries in hybrid-storage blockchain.
- Implements an optimized scheme, ILI-AL*, for enhanced query, verification, and arbitration performance.
- Utilizes BLS signatures for secure and reliable query verification.

## Technology Stack

- Java
- SHA-256 for hashing
- BN254 curve for elliptic curve computations

The smart contract code can be directly deployed on the testing chain provided by Ethereum or on a locally established blockchain. The code includes a verification algorithm for queries.
