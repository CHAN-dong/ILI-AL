In the "CureDB" directory, there are two JAVA projects: "CureDB_EccSig" and "CureDB_hash," along with their corresponding smart contract code in the "smart_contract" folder.

The "CureDB_EccSig" and "CureDB_hash" projects each contain "server" and "dataowner" folders, representing operations specific to the corresponding entities, such as tree construction, updates, queries, and verification. Here, client operations are not distinguished from data owner operations.

The smart contract code can be directly deployed on the testing chain provided by Ethereum or on a locally established blockchain. The code includes a verification algorithm for queries.
